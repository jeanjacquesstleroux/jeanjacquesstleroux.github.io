my name is jean-jacques st. leroux. i'm an undergraduate at [the ohio state University](https://www.osu.edu/) pursuing degrees in theoretical mathematics and computer information systems (class of 26).

for years, it's been my dream to earn my ph.d. to study mathematical optimization & control theory. my niche research interest is in non-deterministic optimization algorithms incorporated in real-time optimization (rto) technology. more broadly, i'm interested in stochastic and nonlinear optimization, machine learning, and self-improving algorithms. i'm motivated by applications in finance, electrical engineering, ML, and OR.

i have research experience in combinatorics & graph theory with [dr. liling ko](https://lilingko.wordpress.com/) and shadowed [dr. sam davanloo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QsBCcBYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for one year in various works in optimization, including being one of the first undergraduates ever to take [ise 7200](https://syllabi.engineering.osu.edu/syllabi/ise_7200). i'm a contributing author to [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/), have held 4 jobs in SWE/quant finance, and have been a recipient of many awards, fellowships, and competitive programs in places like jane street, goldman sachs, headstarter ai, and more. i'm the vp of [ohio state's informs chapter](https://u.osu.edu/informsosu/), a member of [ieee at ohio state](https://activities.osu.edu/involvement/student_organizations/find_a_student_org?i=826), a member and speaker for our [software engineering club](https://osu.dev/team/), and am involved elsewhere in my campus community. i am the cofounder of [obie-mcfarland](https://obiemcfarland.weebly.com/), a fintech/quant startup.

i've been an avid creative writer & artist for 10+ years; my works venture across philosophy, poetry, fiction, and my cultural experience. you can also find me enjoying Nets basketball and tennis, tinkering with computers, at an art gallery, or in guitar lessons. i love to learn from people's stories and experiences, and it's my life mission to use that knowledge to give back to my community and the world at large.
