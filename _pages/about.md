My name is Jean-Jacques St. Leroux. I am an undergraduate student attending [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) pursuing degrees in theoretical Mathematics and Computer Information Systems (class of '26).

For years, it has been my dream to earn my Ph.D. to study mathematical optimization & control. My niche research interest is in non-deterministic optimization algorithms incorporated in real-time optimization (RTO) technology. More broadly, I'm interested in stochastic and nonlinear optimization, machine learning, and self-improving algorithms. I'm especially fascinated with the implications my interests have in finance, electrical engineering, and OR.

I've been an avid creative writer for 10+ years, and my works venture across philosophy, poetry, fiction, and cultural experience. Besides that, you can find me playing basketball and tennis, tinkering with computers, admiring art, or in guitar lessons. I love to learn from people's stories and life experiences, and it's my life mission to use that knowledge to give back to my community and the world at large.
